# Fine-Tune LLAMA Script

This Python script allows you to fine-tune a base machine learning model on your local machine. 
Fine-tuning is a common technique in transfer learning, where you take a pre-trained model and adapt it for a specific task or dataset. 
In this case, we'll be using the LLAMA 7B (clone) model as the base.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, make sure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- Python (3.9 recommended)
- Required Python libraries (specified in `requirements.txt`)

You can install the required libraries by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
